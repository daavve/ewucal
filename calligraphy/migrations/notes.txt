Migrations.

To make a new empty migration
    #python manage.py makemigrations --empty calligraphy

Since loading the initial database can take a long time....

I recommend dumping a copy, and reloading the copy if we have a problem.


pg_dump dbname > outfile


createdb -T template0 dbname
psql dbname < infile
