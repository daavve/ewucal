Interesting:

When in development mode Django serves static files in this order:

1) Any open projects
2) the file located in /usr/lib
    <It then displays a misleading message, suggesting the file is gotten from $STATIC.>


Also:

1)  I bet I can use jquery to toggle making a new box,  probably by adding a button on the side that switches the mouse from "drag stuff around mode"  "into draw a box around a new character" mode.

2)  Since the boxes do not map directly to the location, add some scroll bars to adjust the offset factors for various settings.  See if settings are consistant between documents.

2) From what I can tell, some of the coordinates we have for bounding boxes are not accurate.  We might need to implement some sort of image search functionality to extract the bounding box.


   /* Teaser image swap function */
    $('img.swap').hover(function () {
        this.src = '/images/signup_big_hover.png';
    }, function () {
        this.src = '/images/signup_big.png';
    });

$(function() {
    $("img")
        .mouseover(function() {
            var src = $(this).attr("src").match(/[^\.]+/) + "over.gif";
            $(this).attr("src", src);
        })
        .mouseout(function() {
            var src = $(this).attr("src").replace("over.gif", ".gif");
            $(this).attr("src", src);
        });
});
