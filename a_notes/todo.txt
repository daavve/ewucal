1)  Find out why the image dissapears on Firefox
3)  fix JSON so it represents character positions accurately.  Also, have the website periodically update json from existing information
4)  build functionality to generate JSON character archive on request from user.
5)  Might modify json to include extra info like image link, etc.  -- Maybe have user make custom JSON using checkboxes.
6)  When new window opens, highlight..... and maybe zoom-in on newly selected character
7)  By the comparison slider at the bottom have an image of the character being compared as a reference, probably.
8)  Have a next-page, previous page part to navigate the work.
9)  Maybe to a navigatable document tree on the side.
10) Maybe make scroll bar logorythmic instead of linear.  That would make it more like the interactive maps people are already used to.
11) If we select one character that has multiple copies in the work, then highlight ALL copies of that char in the current work.
12) Figure out on firefox why the image size keeps falling to zero.  I think I might be making firefox work too hard.......
13) Have the origional work, and the comparison work side-by-side (definate ajax with images here)!
14) Users seem to expect to use the mousewheel to zoom in/out of images.  Implement this.
15) Some if your .tif files failed convert for cropping: convert complained about the file being damaged or corrupted.  Ultimately cropped image was not generated
16) Many characters claim to follow the old strategy of coordinent transform, transformed coordinates are not correct


\subsection{if you want to enable image uploading by users}

My professor keeps letting me know that I need to enable uploading of images onto the webserver.  I haven't implemented it yet.  But it shouldn't be too terribly hard.
