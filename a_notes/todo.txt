1)  Find out why the image dissapears on Firefox
2)  Correct database to take into account new .tiff pages converted to smaller png
3)  fix JSON so it represents character positions accurately
4)  build functionality to generate JSON character archive on request from user.
5)  Might modify json to include extra info like image link, etc.  -- Maybe have user make custom JSON using checkboxes.
6)  When new window opens, highlight..... and maybe zoom-in on newly selected character
7)  By the comparison slider at the bottom have an image of the character being compared as a reference, probably.
8)  Have a next-page, previous page part to navigate the work.
9)  Maybe to a navigatable document tree on the side.



\subsection{if you want to enable image uploading by users}

My professor keeps letting me know that I need to enable uploading of images onto the webserver.  I haven't implemented it yet.  But it shouldn't be too terribly hard.
